# Hi there 👋 I'm José Luis Téllez Arreola

I’m a postdoctoral researcher passionate about molecular neurobiology, pharmacogenetics, and the genetic mechanisms of drug resistance. My work focuses on understanding how genetic diversity influences drug responses, particularly in parasitic nematodes, using *Caenorhabditis elegans* as a model organism.

🔬 I’m currently working at the Laboratorio de Genómica Mendeliana y Salud de Precisión, LIIGH-UNAM  
🧠 Research interests: Neurogenetics, CRISPR-Cas9, antihelmintics, molecular pharmacology, and natural product drug discovery
